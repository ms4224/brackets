-made rudimentary view, and got css to make columns

-have a nice css, but now have to BUGS: 1. no scroll on tournament canvas 2.dont have matches centering (this is a problem for the final...)
4/1 - 
- fixed bug where scrolling the tournament canvas left out lines and black background
- fixed bug, can now center matches

NEXT STEPS:
0. FIX BUGS FROM ABOVE!!
1. With svgs and flex stuff, finally got a stable css rendering. lines are connecting to center
next: make lines squary (right now they go direct)
OR: make nice card views
2. consider ngrx for the tournament (not needed yet, but will need when dealing with component).

IDEA:
1. how to handle same tournament service handling team tournaments, etc? - in the tournament object, matches have "fighters"
a. these fighters could be different types or "cards"/fighterData.  there could be a team one, a 3v3 one, etc.
