-Made squary lines
4/5
-quickly added if u click on fighter, it will move them to next round. NEED TO FIX BUG!!! the lines are messed up?
5/16- fixed bug so now connection lines line up correctly with auto wins.  NEED TO FIX TESTS!!!
5/17- Fixed tests and removed files and code for old canvas drawing (using svg now)


NEXT STEPS:
0.Fix unit tests!!!!
1. menu for adding winner? right now set to 1 click
2. consider ngrx for the tournament (not needed yet, but will need when dealing with component).

IDEA:
1. how to handle same tournament service handling team tournaments, etc? - in the tournament object, matches have "fighters"
a. these fighters could be different types or "cards"/fighterData.  there could be a team one, a 3v3 one, etc.
