-made setwinner function correctly place the winner in the next bracket position (handles case of auto-win being present in next bracket as well)

NEXT STEPS:
1. hmmm....start making basic front end view?  what functionality is missing
2. consider ngrx for the tournament (not needed yet, but will need when dealing with component).

IDEA:
1. how to handle same tournament service handling team tournaments, etc? - in the tournament object, matches have "fighters"
a. these fighters could be different types or "cards"/fighterData.  there could be a team one, a 3v3 one, etc.
