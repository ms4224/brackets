-started modifying existing functions to autocreate "Bys" for tournament rounds with odd number of contestants.
-logic for this finished, but changed interface structures, which messed up some tests.  Need to fix the tests and also check in the tests
that autowins are created (randomly, so check by arrays).  May want to write assertion function for these as the unit tests are getting long.

NEXT STEPS:
1. how to add winners through functions, etc.  and how to handle odd number brackets auto wins?
2. consider ngrx for the tournament (not needed yet, but will need when dealing with component).

IDEA:
1. how to handle same tournament service handling team tournaments, etc? - in the tournament object, matches have "fighters"
a. these fighters could be different types or "cards"/fighterData.  there could be a team one, a 3v3 one, etc.
