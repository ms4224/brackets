-made rudimentary view, and got css to make columns

NEXT STEPS:
1. STyling was buggy, gonna have to stick to robotronic layout or sac the lines.  next steps?
2. consider ngrx for the tournament (not needed yet, but will need when dealing with component).

IDEA:
1. how to handle same tournament service handling team tournaments, etc? - in the tournament object, matches have "fighters"
a. these fighters could be different types or "cards"/fighterData.  there could be a team one, a 3v3 one, etc.
