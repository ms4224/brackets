--removed final? boolean from rounddata, wasnt being used.  may add later
-first round based on players and subsequent tournament round data is ready.

NEXT STEPS:
1. how to add winners through functions, etc.  and how to handle odd number brackets auto wins?
2. consider ngrx for the tournament (not needed yet, but will need when dealing with component).
